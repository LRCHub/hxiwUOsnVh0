[00:00.32] Do the bad thing
[00:04.80] Take off your wedding ring
[00:09.23] But it won't make it that much easier
[00:14.03] It might make it worse
[00:25.03] 
[00:16.78] Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
[00:18.80] Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
[00:21.20] She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
[00:24.31] He's not the jealous type
[00:26.53] And I only need to get half an excuse, and I'm away
[00:29.72] But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
[00:33.81] I've been before
[00:35.69] And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
[00:39.67] See, she's talking, but I'm not entirely sure
[01:02.17] 
[00:57.66] Do the bad thing
[01:04.84] Take off your wedding ring
[01:09.92] But it won't make it that much easier
[01:14.38] It might make it worse
[01:25.38] 
[01:17.02] Oh, a sudden disheartener
[01:19.02] Somebody's partner's talking to me
[01:21.05] But I don't know that is what she isn't
[01:23.34] She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
[01:27.11] And I knew, how could she not? She could have anyone she wants
[01:30.05] And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
[01:56.05] 
[01:34.49] Like, "I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
[01:37.93] And let me waste your time
[01:40.56] Really, love, it's fine"
[01:42.56] I said really, love, it's fine
[01:57.56] 
[01:59.50] And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
[02:05.03] I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
[02:09.07] Oh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
[02:13.78] She said, "It's the red wine this time", but that is no excuse
